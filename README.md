# Pandas Matplotlib session

Download both the Jupyter notebook and ```session_data.zip``` in the same directory on your local machine. Unzip the ```session_data.zip``` file and open Jupyter through Anaconda Python, which can be accessed through Imperial College's [AppsAnywhere platform](https://softwarehub.imperial.ac.uk/).

The session is intended to last approximately 2 hours and aims to act as an introduction to both Pandas and Matplotlib.
